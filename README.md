This Brute Force Client can only
break into http servers. (port 80)
Also the server MUST be a server
that requires a username and password

This client doesn't work on regular login forums.
Most vulnurable servers that work with
this client can be found using Shodan.

Because they made the original brute force
script! All I did was teak it and patch it so that it could work with Pythonista 3!
